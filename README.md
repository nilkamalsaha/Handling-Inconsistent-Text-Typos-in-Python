# Handling-Inconsistent-Text-Typos-in-Python

You can fix inconsistent text & typos by using:

1. .loc[] to update a value at a particular location
2. np.where() to update values in a column based on a condition statement
3. .map() to map a set of values to another set of values
4. String methods like str.lower(), str.strip() & str.replace() to clean text data

## Assignment
Hi again, 

Thanks for your help with the missing data yesterday. I like how you decided to handle those missing values.

Can you check the same file for inconsistencies in the text and resolve any issues that you find?

Thanks !

Alan
